- Should have started from a mobile size screen

- Bootstrap may be more trouble than it is worth

- Deploying to gh-pages lost the icons when using absolute paths. To solve:
    - Move icons from public into src 
    - Use relative pathing (which only works within src)
    - Add a <base> tag to index.html
